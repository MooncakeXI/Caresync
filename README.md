# Caresync
CareSync is a Blockchain-based project that combines skin condition detection through image uploads with personal health data management. This platform enables users to conduct preliminary skin condition checks from home, while also offering them the choice to exchange health data for tokens voluntarily, benefiting both personal and public health initiatives.

## Concept of the Project

CareSyncâ€™s core concept is to leverage Blockchain for securely managing health data that benefits society, while prioritizing user privacy. This allows users to access free initial disease screenings without visiting a hospital, and the data on outbreak trends gathered from users can guide public health measures. Our goal is to create a safe, transparent health data network that supports public health and empowers users.

## Project Objectives

- **Preliminary Health Assessment**: Users can upload images of affected skin areas, such as rashes or fungal infections, which are then processed by our AI model to give a preliminary diagnosis.
- **Data Exchange for Tokens**: Users have the option to consent to data sharing in exchange for tokens, supporting public health analysis and providing value back to the user.
- **Tracking Disease Outbreaks**: Health data is aggregated and analyzed for disease outbreak patterns in various regions, without any personal identifiers. This information helps hospitals and public health agencies address outbreaks effectively.
- **Health Promotion**: Users receive free preliminary health assessments and token rewards while contributing valuable data for public health benefits.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling and design.
- **Rust**: For Blockchain development and efficient data processing.
- **TensorFlow**: For developing and training the AI model that analyzes users' photos.

## User Benefits

- Access to initial skin condition assessments without needing a hospital visit.
- Token rewards in exchange for data that helps analyze disease outbreak patterns (voluntary).
- Supporting hospitals and public agencies to monitor and respond to health outbreaks promptly.

## Data Privacy

CareSync values user privacy. All health data is securely stored on the Blockchain without including any personal information. Data shared for public health purposes is anonymous, used solely for statistical analysis to improve public health measures.
